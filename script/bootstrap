# =============================================================================
# Uses bundler to install all gems specified in the Gemfile under vendor/gems,
# records the load path in config/loadpath, and generates bundler-free binstubs
# under bin.
#
# The basic idea is to use bundler to install necessary gems but not
# rely on it to manage the load path at runtime because it's slow. Requiring
# 'bundler/setup' takes ~500ms user CPU time in production and ~1500ms in
# development/test. This makes it unusable in scenarios that require a fast
# boot (e.g., script/gerve, proxymachine daemons, ernie/smoke, etc.). It's also
# a problem in development where it slows tools like rake command line
# completion to a crawl and adds at least a second to single-file test runs.
#
# There's very little reason to use bundler at runtime since everything
# is known at install time. We simply save off the result of the work done by
# bundle/setup and use it until bundle-install is run again.
