  * Remember default dir (last used directory) in editor.
  * JSON::Editor.edit method added, the editor can now receive json texts from
    the clipboard via C-v.
  * Load json texts from an URL pasted via middle button press.
  * Added :create_additions option to Parser. This makes it possible to disable
    the creation of additions by force, in order to treat json texts as data
    while having additions loaded.
  * Jacob Maine <jmaine@blurb.com> reported, that JSON(:foo) outputs a JSON
    object if the rails addition is enabled, which is wrong. It now outputs a
    JSON string "foo" instead, like suggested by Jacob Maine.
  * Discovered a bug in the Ruby Bugs Tracker on rubyforge, that was reported
    by John Evans lgastako@gmail.com. He could produce a crash in the JSON
    generator by returning something other than a String instance from a
    to_json method. I now guard against this by doing a rather crude type
    check, which raises an exception instead of crashing.
2007-07-06 (1.1.1)
  * Yui NARUSE <naruse@airemix.com> sent some patches to fix tests for Ruby
    1.9. I applied them and adapted some of them a bit to run both on 1.8 and
    1.9.
  * Introduced a JSON.parse! method without depth checking for people who like
    danger.
  * Made generate and pretty_generate methods configurable by an options hash.
  * Added :allow_nan option to parser and generator in order to handle NaN,
    Infinity, and -Infinity correctly - if requested. Floats, which aren't numbers,
    aren't valid JSON according to RFC4627, so by default an exception will be
    raised if any of these symbols are encountered. Thanks to Andrea Censi
    <andrea.censi@dis.uniroma1.it> for his hint about this.
  * Fixed some more tests for Ruby 1.9.
  * Implemented dump/load interface of Marshal as suggested in ruby-core:11405
    by murphy <murphy@rubychan.de>.
  * Implemented the max_nesting feature for generate methods, too.
  * Added some implementations for ruby core's custom objects for
    serialisation/deserialisation purposes.
2007-05-21 (1.1.0)
  * Implemented max_nesting feature for parser to avoid stack overflows for
    data from untrusted sources. If you trust the source, you can disable it
    with the option max_nesting => false.
  * Piers Cawley <pdcawley@bofh.org.uk> reported a bug, that not every
    character can be escaped by ?\ as required by RFC4627. There's a
    contradiction between David Crockford's JSON checker test vectors (in
    tests/fixtures) and RFC4627, though. I decided to stick to the RFC, because
    the JSON checker seems to be a bit older than the RFC.
  * Extended license to Ruby License, which includes the GPL.
  * Added keyboard shortcuts, and 'Open location' menu item to edit_json.rb.
2007-05-09 (1.0.4)
  * Applied a patch from Yui NARUSE <naruse@airemix.com> to make JSON compile
    under Ruby 1.9. Thank you very much for mailing it to me!
  * Made binary variants of JSON fail early, instead of falling back to the
    pure version. This should avoid overshadowing of eventual problems while
    loading of the binary.
2007-03-24 (1.0.3)
  * Improved performance of pure variant a bit.
  * The ext variant of this release supports the mswin32 platform. Ugh!
2007-03-24 (1.0.2)
  * Ext Parser didn't parse 0e0 correctly into 0.0: Fixed!
2007-03-24 (1.0.1)
  * Forgot some object files in the build dir. I really like that - not!
2007-03-24 (1.0.0)
  * Added C implementations for the JSON generator and a ragel based JSON
    parser in C.
  * Much more tests, especially fixtures from json.org.
  * Further improved conformance to RFC4627.
2007-02-09 (0.4.3)
  * Conform more to RFC4627 for JSON: This means JSON strings
    now always must contain exactly one object "{ ... }" or array "[ ... ]" in
    order to be parsed without raising an exception. The definition of what
    constitutes a whitespace is narrower in JSON than in Ruby ([ \t\r\n]), and
    there are differences in floats and integers (no octals or hexadecimals) as
    well.
  * Added aliases generate and pretty_generate of unparse and pretty_unparse.
  * Fixed a test case.
  * Catch an Iconv::InvalidEncoding exception, that seems to occur on some Sun
    boxes with SunOS 5.8, if iconv doesn't support utf16 conversions. This was
    reported by Andrew R Jackson <andrewj@bcm.tmc.edu>, thanks a bunch!
2006-08-25 (0.4.2)
  * Fixed a bug in handling solidi (/-characters), that was reported by
    Kevin Gilpin <kevin.gilpin@alum.mit.edu>.
2006-02-06 (0.4.1)
  * Fixed a bug related to escaping with backslashes. Thanks for the report go
    to Florian Munz <surf@theflow.de>.
2005-09-23 (0.4.0)
  * Initial Rubyforge Version
