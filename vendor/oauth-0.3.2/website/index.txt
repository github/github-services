h1. Ruby OAuth GEM

h2. What

This is a RubyGem for implementing both OAuth clients and servers in Ruby applications.

See the "OAuth specs":http://oauth.net/core/1.0/

h2. Installing

<pre syntax="ruby">sudo gem install oauth</pre>

You can also install it from the "oauth rubyforge project":http://rubyforge.org/projects/oauth/.

The source code is now hosted on the "OAuth GitHub Project":http://github.com/pelle/oauth/tree/master

h2. The basics

This is a ruby library which is intended to be used in creating Ruby Consumer and Service Provider applications. It is NOT a Rails plugin, but could easily be used for the foundation for such a Rails plugin.

As a matter of fact it has been pulled out from an "OAuth Rails Plugin":http://code.google.com/p/oauth-plugin/ which now requires this GEM.

h2. Demonstration of usage

Create a new consumer instance by passing it a configuration hash:

<pre><code>@consumer=OAuth::Consumer.new( "key","secret", {
    :site=>"https://agree2"
    })</code></pre>

Start the process by requesting a token

<pre><code>@request_token=@consumer.get_request_token
session[:request_token]=@request_token
redirect_to @request_token.authorize_url</code></pre>

When user returns create an access_token

<pre><code>@access_token=@request_token.get_access_token
@photos=@access_token.get('/photos.xml')</code></pre>

For more detailed instructions I have written this "OAuth Client Tutorial":http://stakeventures.com/articles/2008/02/23/developing-oauth-clients-in-ruby and "How to turn your rails site into an OAuth Provider ":http://stakeventures.com/articles/2007/11/26/how-to-turn-your-rails-site-into-an-oauth-provider.

Finally be sure to check out the "OAuth RDoc Manual":http://oauth.rubyforge.org/rdoc/.
