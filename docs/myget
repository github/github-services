MyGet allows you to create and host your own NuGet feed. Include packages from
the official NuGet feed or upload your own NuGet packages. We can also compile
and package your source code from GitHub, BitBucket, CodePlex and more!

The GitHub MyGet service can be used to trigger builds after changes have been
pushed to your GitHub repository.
