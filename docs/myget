MyGet allows you to create and host your own NuGet feed. Include packages from
the official NuGet feed or upload your own NuGet packages. We can also compile
and package your source code from GitHub, BitBucket, CodePlex and more!

The GitHub MyGet service can be used to trigger builds after changes have been
pushed to your GitHub repository.

Install Notes
-------------

1. Login to https://www.myget.org. If you are on the Enterprise plan,
   login through that URL instead.
   
2. Navigate to the feed's build services setup for which you want to
   automatically trigger builds when changes have been pushed to GitHub.
   
3. For the build, copy the Hook (HTTP POST) URL into the Hook URL field.
