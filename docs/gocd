[Go](http://go.cd) (also GoCD) is a Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) server.

The GitHub GoCD service can be used to trigger builds when changes are pushed to the corresponding GitHub repository.
This is a replacement for the polling method, where the Go server periodically polls the repositories for changes.

Install Notes
-------------

1. Your Go server must be accessible from the internet.

2. "base_url" (mandatory) is the URL to your Go server
   Example: https://go.example.com/ or http://go.example.com:8153

3. "repository_url" (mandatory) is the URL that is configured in the Materials section of the concerned pipelines.
   Example: git@github.com:gocd/gocd.git or git://github.com/gocd/gocd

4. "username" and "password" - username and password of a Go admin user that can
   trigger the Materials API endpoint. Can be left empty if the Go server has no authentication configured (not recommended.)

5. "verify_ssl" is used to enable (recommended) or disable certificate checking when using ssl.
   Disabling this can make the ssl connection insecure.
