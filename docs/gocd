[Go](http://go.cd) (also GoCD) is a Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) server.

The GitHub GoCD service can be used to trigger builds when changes are pushed to the corresponding GitHub repository.
This is a replacement for the polling method, where the Go server periodically polls the repositories for changes.

This integration completely repeats the webhook API. Read the official instructions on setting up
webhook push [here](https://api.gocd.org/current/#hosting-your-repository-on-github-or-github-enterprise).

**Note:** Polling must be turned off for the pipeline associated with this material.

Install Notes
-------------

1. Your Go server must be accessible from the internet.

2. "base_url" (mandatory) is the domain (and port) of your Go server (don't specify the url part `/go/api/webhooks/github/notify`)
   Example: https://gocd.example.com:8154

3. "webhook_secret" - to secure the http endpoint you should specify the same
    value the webhookSecret attribute on the <server/> element has in the file `cruise-config.xml`.

4. "verify_ssl" is used to enable (recommended) or disable certificate checking when using ssl.
   Disabling this can make the ssl connection insecure.
