[heroku](https://heroku.com) is a hosting platform with support for a large number of languages.

By enabling this hook, GitHub will request a [heroku build](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/platform-api-reference#build-create) that pushes your code to a named heroku application when a [deployment event](https://developer.github.com/webhooks/#events) is received.

To trigger deployment events you'll need to [create a deployment](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/deployments/#create-a-deployment) with the API.

There's a [hubot-deploy](https://github.com/atmos/hubot-deploy) script that allows you to deploy from chat. Heroku has various options for [deploy hooks](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/deploy-hooks) to give you feedback.

The [auto-deployment](http://www.atmos.org/github-services/auto-deployment/) service exists for creating deployments automatically on push and successful CI runs.
