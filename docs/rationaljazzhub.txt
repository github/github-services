This service integrates github with Rational's JazzHub service (http://hub.jazz.net). The service automatically adds comments into work item specified by the commit message. Additionally, this hook allows you to create new work items from commits.

Use the pattern "[#<workItemNumber>] Commit text" to add a comment to the work item with the number specified in the commit message. E.g.
	"[#32] Fix an annoying bug."

Note that the '#' is optional. 

Use the pattern "[workItemType] Fix an annoying bug" to create a new work item for type workItemType. Note, that you have to enter the workItemType id instead of the name. E.g.
	"[defect] Fox an annoying bug"

This implementation supports both form based and basic authentication.

Install Notes
-------------

A user with the correct licenses to add comments and create work items needs to be created. 

Configuring the github hook:

1. Username - This is the username of the user used to access your Rational Team Concert instance.
2. Password - This is the password of the user used to access your Rational Team Concert instance.
