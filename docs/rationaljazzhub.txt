JazzHub
=======

This service integrates GitHub with Rational's JazzHub service (http://hub.jazz.net). The hook automatically adds change set links into the work item specified by the commit message.

The hook will recognize any of the common work item type names in the commit message and look for a corresponding work item.

For example:
   - "Fix bug 42"
   - "Deliver Story 99"
   - "[work item 999] fixed some stuff"

Install Notes
-------------

The JazzHub hook needs to be configured with your JazzHub login info:

1. Username - This is the username of the user used to access JazzHub.
2. Password - This is the password of the user used to access JazzHub.
