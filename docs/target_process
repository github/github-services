Commit Message Syntax
---------------------

General comment format for adding comments and/or changing entity states:


	#[Entity ID]:<new state>
	Eg: Fixed out of memory exceptions #1221:Fixed


The entire line will appear as a comment in your User Story, Bug, or Task; and the entity's
state will be changed to the state name, if specified.  A new state is not required, and an
Assignable's state will not change unless it is specified.  Entity ID is required.  This 
text sequence can appear anywhere in your commit message.
