  2.  Set "the Source Control URL for diffs" field to be:
      https://github.com/[github_username]/^REPO/commit/^R2

you want to use multiple GitHub accounts, please read:

  1.  Set your Cvssubmit Url.

  2.  Set "Fb Version" to "6" (without quotes).

  3.  Leave "Fb Repoid" blank.

Examples:

  * case(s): 12345, 67890, [additional]
  * bug(s)ID: 12345, 67890, [additional]
