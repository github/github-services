DiveCloud integrates Application Performance Testing into the Continuous Integration Cycle by allowing you to run a performance test after each successful deployment.

When Github receives notice that you have successfully deployed your application, it will initiate a performance test based on the test plan you created at https://divecloud.nouvola.com. 

Please enter your API Key and the Plan ID for the plan that you would like to run on successful deployment of your application. 

If you would like to add 'Think Time' to you test, select the 'Think Time' checkbox. 

If your test plan includes credentials, include your credential password in the field below.
