AMQP
========

This service lets you publish push and commit messages to a message broker
(like RabbitMQ) via the AMQP protocol.


Install Notes
-------------

  1. Server is the hostname of the broker
  2. Port is the port to connect (AMQP default is 5672)
  3. Vhost is the vhost to use while publishing (default is '/')
  4. Exchange is the exchange to use while publishing
      * Note that the exchange is a durable topic exchange
      ** Future versions may allow you to configure this
  5. Username is the user to use when publishing to the exchange
  6. Password is the pasword to use when publishing to the exchange
      * Note that SSL isn't supported yet

  Messages are sent for a push with the following routing key format:
        "github.push.#{owner}.#{repo}.#{ref}"
    where:
        owner = payload['repository']['owner']['name']
        repo  = payload['repository']['name']
        ref   = payload['ref_name']

  Messages are also sent for each commit in a push, with the following routing
  key format:
        "github.commit.#{owner}.#{repo}.#{ref}.#{author}"
    where:
        author = commit['author']['email']
        (other fields are the same as above)
