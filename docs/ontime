Install Notes
-------------

In order to properly configure OnTime and GitHub to work together a few settings have to be configured.

1. Log into your OnTime v11.1+ installation as the Administrator or with a user that has System Options privledges.

2. Open up the "Tools" menu and click on "System Options" and then go to the "GitHub Integration" option in the left pane.

3. Make sure that "Enable GitHub Integration" is checked and that an API Key exists. If it doesn't then click "Generate a New API Key" to make one

4. Copy the API key and paste that into the OnTime service hook in your GitHub repository.

NOTE: If you have a non-hosted installation of OnTime your installation must have access to the internet. Hosted accounts already have internet access.

Usage
-----

When entering in commit messages in Git, any message that contains a specially formatted OnTime tag will attempted to be linked to the respective OnTime item. The tag is formatted as follows:

    [otx: id# (wl: # timeunit)]

* Where the `x` in `otx` can be:
  * `d` for defects (i.e. `otd`)
  * `f` for features (i.e. `otf`)
  * `t` for tasks (i.e. `ott`)
  * `i` for incidents (i.e. `oti`)
  * NOTE: d, f, t and i are constant even if you've renamed the fields in your OnTime installation.
* `id#` is the id number of the item that the commit links to
* `wl: # timeunit` is optional. When provided it will add a worklog entry to that item after the commit is pushed to github.
  * `#` is some non-negative real number
  * `timeunit` is a valid timeunit that is used in your installation, either fully spelled or abbreviated with respect to your OnTime timeunit pick list configuration

A few examples of valid tags (assuming you have hours as a timeunit in OnTime and it's abbreviated spelling is 'hrs'):

    [otd: 45]

    [otf: 2]

    [otf: 823 wl: 5 hours]

    [ott: 92 wl: 8.3 hrs]

    [oti: srx0091]
