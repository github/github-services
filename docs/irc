IRC
========

Install Notes
-------------

1.  `server` (ie. irc.freenode.net)
2.  `port` is normally 6667 / 9999 for ssl
3.  the `room` field can support multiple rooms (comma separated)
4.  the `password` field is for the server password
5.  room passwords can be specified for each room like this:
        room_name::password
6.  prefixing '#' to the room field is optional
7.  `nick` is not required.  If provided, the IRCBot will use that
    nick.
8.  Enable `long_url` so that compare/commit url's are not passed
    through bit.ly.
9.  Enable `message_without_join' to keep the GitHub IRC bot from
    joining and immediately leaving the channel for each push.
10. Enable `no_colors` to disable colors in the messages sent by the
    GitHub IRC bot.
11. Enable Active and Notice checkboxes
12. Configure your IRC channel to allow external messages (/mode #yourchannelname -n).

For troubleshooting, run the following curl command to get diagnostic information from GitHub. 

    # Replace 
    # USERNAME:PASSWORD with your GitHub username and password. Username is your full username as used when signing in. 
    # USERNAME/REPONAME with your repo name as it shows in github. 
    
    $ curl -u "USERNAME:PASSWORD" -in https://api.github.com/repos/USERNAME/REPONAME/hooks
