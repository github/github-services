IRC
========

Install Notes
-------------

1. `server` (ie. irc.freenode.net)
2. `port` is normally 6667 / 9999 for ssl
3. the `room` field can support multiple rooms (comma separated)
4. the `password` field is for the server password
5. room passwords can be specified for each room like this:
       room_name::password
6. prefixing '#' to the room field is optional
7. `nick` is not required.  If provided, the IRCBot will use that
   nick.
8. Enable `long_url` so that compare/commit url's are not passed
   through bit.ly.
9. Enable `message_without_join' to keep the GitHub IRC bot from
   joining and immediately leaving the channel for each push.
