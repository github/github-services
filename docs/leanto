Lean-to
=======

The current version of Lean-To adds the ability to automatically link specific commits at GitHub with stories and bugs in your Lean-To projects.  This feature is currently experimental and is only enabled for internal Refactr projects. If you would like access to this experimental feature please email support@lean-to.com.

Using the integration is as simple as tagging a Lean-To story or bug in your commit message:

    This is my commit message.  I fixed a bug.
    [Bug:7]

When you push to GitHub it passes a list of commits to Lean-To which scans the commit messages for tags like `[Bug:7]`.  If tags are found, Lean-To will automatically add a note to the card with the commit message and a link back to the actual commit.  The tags may also contain a directive to change certain properties of the card:

    Added feature foo. [Story:17, status:completed]

In this example, Lean-To would add a note to the story and mark it as completed.  Lean-To also tries to match your GitHub account to a Lean-To account and will mark you as the owner of the story if you change the status of a story and it doesn't already have an owner. 

GitHub integration is currently enabled for the **Milemarker**, **Lean-To**, **Realief**, and **Qualtrx** projects for internal testing.

### Tag Syntax
* Tags must start and end with square brackets, e.g. `[Story:1]`
* Tags are case-insensitive so `[story:1]` is equivalent to `[Story:1]`
* There must be a colon between 'Story' or 'Bug' and the number so `[Story:1]` is valid but `[bug7]` is not
* Property directives are optional. They must be separated by a comma, and they must follow the card identifier, e.g. `[Bug:1, status:completed, actual:1]`
* Valid status values are: '**not** started', '**in** progress', '**complete**d'
* Only the bold portion of the status value is required so `[Bug:1, status:in progress]` is equivalent to `[Bug:1, status:in]`
* Multiple tags may be specified in a single commit message so `[Story:3] [Bug:1, status:complete]` will add notes to both Story 3 and Bug 1
* Acceptable card properties are: 'status', 'priority', 'iteration', 'estimate', and 'actual'
* Card properties do not need to be in any order as long as they follow the card identifier. So `[Story:1, iteration:2, estimate:1/2]` is valid, but `[status:completed, Story:1]` is not.
* Acceptable estimates are '0', '1/4', '0.25', '1/2', '0.5', '1', '2', '3', '5', '8', '13', '20', 40', and '80'. '0' will clear the estimate, and the rest will translate to their equivalent Lean-to estimate values.
