-------------

1. Workspace - This your workspace key. For instance if your Jenkins URL is https://jenkins.shiningpanda-ci.com/shiningpanda.org/, then your workspace key is "shiningpanda.org".
2. Job - This is the name of the job you want to trigger upon commit. For instance if the URL of your job in Jenkins is https://jenkins.shiningpanda-ci.com/shiningpanda.org/job/selenose/, then your job name is selenose.
3. Token - This is the value of the "Authentication Token" field of the "Trigger builds remotely (e.g., from scripts)" option in the "Build Triggers" section of your job configuration.
4. Branches (optional) - This is a space-separated list of branches to listen for commits on. Commits to other branches will not trigger your job. If no branches are specified, jobs are triggered for all commits.
5. Parameters (optional) - If your job takes parameters, this is the query string built from the parameters and their value (for instance "arg1=foo&arg2=bar"). All parameters have to be properly URL-escaped.
