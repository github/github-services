Install Notes
-------------

  API Token is a flow-specific token. You can find it either in the flow, or in Flowdock's Integrations help page at https://www.flowdock.com/help/integrations.

  Multiple flows may be specified with multiple comma-separated tokens.

  To include certain tags with every message, you can add tags to the tokens. Use + to separate tags. For example, "65f80e994031fcd80f57d1a9e294c1d1d+frontend+web,af8629b07978d1223c9d48d05ff1356+fyi" would add `frontend` and `web` tags to the messages posted to the first flow, and `fyi` to the messages posted to the second flow.

Configure From Flowdock
-----------------------

  You can also configure hooks from within Flowdock. Those hooks will appear in the `Web Hooks` category of the service hooks. This can be done from the flowâ€™s inbox settings.
