Heroku - DeployBot
==================

Deploys heroku apps from a git repo emails the result to collaborators based on config vars.
Check [deploybot](https://github.com/abhishekmunie/deploybot) repo for details.
The hook posts a request at `https://deploybot.heroku.com/:your-heroku-app` to initiate deploy.
