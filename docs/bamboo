Bamboo
=======

Bamboo is a continuous integration server that automates the building and testing of your software.
The github Bamboo service can be used to trigger builds after code has been pushed to your git repository.

Install Notes
-------------

1.  Your Bamboo server must be accessible from the internet.

2.  "base_url" is the URL to your Bamboo server
    Example: https://bamboo.example.com/ or http://bamboo.example.com/bamboo/

3.  "build_key" is the identifier of the plan you want to trigger
    Example: "BAM-TRUNK", where BAM = project key, TRUNK = plan key

    A compound build key value can be used to specify multiple builds or associate
    specific branches with a build
    Example: "master:BAM-TRUNK,3-2-patches:BAM-32PATCH,BAM-TESTS", where BAM-TRUNK 
    will be triggered only by pushes to the master branch, BAM-32PATCH will only
    be triggered by pushes to the 3-2-patches branch, and BAM-TESTS will be triggered
    for any push.

4.  "username" and "password" - username and password of a Bamboo user that can
    trigger a manual build of the Bamboo plan defined in "build_key"
