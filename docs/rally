Rally (http://www.rallydev.com) is the recognized leader in Agile 
application lifecycle management (ALM). Rally is dedicated to helping 
organizations embrace Agile and Lean development and portfolio management 
practices that dramatically increase the pace of innovation, improve 
product quality and boost customer satisfaction.

The GitHub-Services integration for Rally creates Changeset/Change 
information in Rally associated with the Workspace and SCMRepository 
of your choice.  In Rally, when looking at an artifact, you can see 
detail on Changesets associated with commits from GitHub push activities.  
Rally also provides reports that use the Artifact, Changeset and Change 
information to provide insight into files that get changed frequently 
or that are associated with higher than normal defect rates and other 
useful metrics based reports.

The integration scans for tokens in the commit message that conform to a
Rally Artifact FormattedID format.  These tokens are validated against 
Rally so that a reference to a valid Rally Artifact (UserStory, Defect, 
TestCase, Task, etc.) results in the association of the Artifact to the 
Changeset posted in Rally performed by this integration.
Commits containing a commit message that doesn't have a valid artifact 
reference also get posted to Rally so that they show up in any Rally 
reports against Changesets/Changes.

NB: Uri fields in Rally Changeset/Change records refer the to master branch.
