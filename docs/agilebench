1. **token** - is a user's API token.  Get it from your Agile Bench's user settings page.

2. **project_id** - can be found in your Agile Bench project URL.  i.e. if the URL is http://agilebench.com/projects/3000-my-project, then the project id will be 3000.

Git Commit example: `$ git commit -am "[Fixes #5 #6] Added even more documentation"` - will add _"Added even more documentation"_ to stories #5 and #6 and move stories #5 & #6 into the last (the fixed!) workflow state.
