Redmine Service has the following modules:

1. Fetch GitHub Commits
-----------------------

Notifies an instance of Redmine, a project management tool, to fetch the new commits from GitHub.

Install Notes
-------------

1. Download and install Redmine from http://redmine.org
2. Activate "Enable WS for repository management" in the global settings. While there, generate an API key (if neccessary) and copy it.
3. Set your github repository as git repository for a project.
4. Enter the full URL to your Redmine instance as well as the project's identifier and the API key.
5. Check the "Fetch GitHub Commits" option to enable the module.
6. We will then notify your Redmine whenever you do a "git push".

Note: The GitHub servers need to have access to "sys/fetch_changesets". Some older tutorials have you add a rule to your server config to
allow access to sys/ only from localhost. Since it is now possible to use an API key, this is no longer necessary.

Notifies an instance of Redmine, a project management tool, to fetch the new commits from GitHub.

2. Update Redmine Issues about related commits
----------------------------------------------
