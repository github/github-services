This service replaces the Rational JazzHub service to integrate GitHub with IBM Bluemix DevOps Services (http://hub.jazz.net).  The hook automatically adds change set links in the work item specified by the commit message.

The hook will recognize any of the common work item type names in the commit message and look for a corresponding work item.

For example:
   - "Fix bug 42"
   - "Deliver Story 99"
   - "[work item 999] fixed some stuff"

Install Notes
-------------

The IBM Bluemix DevOps Services hook needs to be configured with your DevOps Services login info:

1. Ibm - The user ID that is used to access DevOps Services.
2. Ibm password - The password for the user ID that is used to access DevOps Services. If your organization uses federated authentication, you must use a personal access token. See [Setting up the GitHub hook](https://hub.jazz.net/docs/githubhooks/#github_hook) for details.
3. Project membership - The configured user needs to be a member of the DevOps Services project.
4. Override server url - The DevOps Services server url (for IBM internal testing only).
