This service replaces the Rational JazzHub service to integrate GitHub with IBM Bluemix DevOps Services (http://hub.jazz.net).  The hook automatically adds change set links in the work item specified by the commit message.

The hook will recognize any of the common work item type names in the commit message and look for a corresponding work item.

For example:
   - "Fix bug 42"
   - "Deliver Story 99"
   - "[work item 999] fixed some stuff"

Install Notes
