Commit message checker
======================

Install Notes
-------------

1. Ruby regular expression that repository commit messages will be validated against e.g.
   to require that commit messages are of the following form:

"XYZW-99999: implement Hyper Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol
   
 Make Xyzw support HTCPCP v1.0 as described by RFC 2324.
 ..."

   use the following regular expression:
   
   ^XYZW-\d{1,5}: [\w ]{10,50}$(\n\n\w.*)?


2. Email notification message template described using the Liquid markup language.
   If missing, a default template will be used.  

   For Liquid template documentation please see:
   https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki


3. Email notification message subject field value.
   If missing, a default subject will be used.

4. Notification message recipients.
   The notification message is always addressed directly to the committer.
   Additional recipients may optionally be specified using this field.
   The value must be a comma separated list of valid email addresses.
