Bugly
=====

Bugly is a hosted bug and issue tracker. Integrating it with GitHub
allows you to associate commits with issues and see commits in all 
timelines.


Install Notes
-------------

  1. 'token' (REQUIRED) is an API token with read/write access to the 
     account/project. Click the '+' sign in the lower left corner of
     your Bugly account, then click New token to create a new token
     for your user. Or click Quick Access, then the user you wish to
     create a token for, then click the API tokens tab, then click
     New API token.

  2. 'account_name' (REQUIRED) is your Bugly account name. It would be 
     'foobar' in the following URL: http://foobar.bug.ly/

  3. 'project_id' (OPTIONAL) is the ID of the Bugly project to associate 
     all commits with. If no project_id is provided, commits will only
     appear in the account-wide timeline, not project timelines. The ID 
     would be '321' in this URL: http://foo.bug.ly/projects/321-MyProject
