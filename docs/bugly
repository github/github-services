Bugly is a hosted bug and issue tracker. Integrating it with GitHub
allows you to associate commits with issues and see commits in all
timelines.


Install Notes
-------------

  1. 'token' (REQUIRED) is an API token with read/write access to the
     account/project. Go to Control Panel, Users, click on a user,
     click the API Tokens tab, then click New token to create a new token.

  2. 'account_name' (REQUIRED) is your Bugly account name. It would be
     'foobar' in the following URL: http://foobar.bug.ly/

  3. 'project_id' (OPTIONAL) is the ID of the Bugly project to associate
     all commits with. If no project_id is provided, commits will only
     appear in the account-wide timeline, not project timelines. The ID
     would be '321' in this URL: http://foo.bug.ly/projects/321-MyProject
