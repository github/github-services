Datadog is a monitoring service for IT, Operations and Development teams who
write and run applications at scale, and want to turn the massive amounts of
data produced by their apps, tools and services into actionable insight.

This service hook will inform Datadog every time you push to GitHub.
On every push Datadog will create an event in your account's timeline, enabling
visual overlay of commits and pushes over time, and correlating these to other
events.
