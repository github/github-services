VersionEye is a notification system for software libraries. It notifies you about outdated dependencies, license violations and security vulnerabilities in your repository.

Currently it works for:

* Composer (PHP)
* Bundler (Ruby)
* PIP (Python)
* NPM (Node.JS)
* Bower (JavaScript)
* CocoaPods (Objective-C)
* Leiningen (Clojure)
* Maven (Java)
* SBT (Scala)
* Gradle (Groovy)
* Biicode (C/C++)

Coming soon:

* Nuget (.NET)
* Go
* Dart

This service hook will inform VersionEye every time you push to GitHub. VersionEye will reparse your project file if it has changed.
