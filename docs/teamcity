TeamCity
=======

TeamCity is a continuous integration server that automates the building and testing of your software.
The github TeamCity service can be used to trigger builds after code has been pushed to your git repository.

Install Notes
-------------

  1.  Your TeamCity server must be accessible from the internet.

  2.  "base_url" is the URL to your TeamCity server
      Example: https://teamcity.example.com/ or http://teamcity.example.com/teamcity/

  3.  "build_type_id" is the identifier of the build configuration you want to trigger
      Example: "bt123", which can be found in URL of the build configuration page ("...viewType.html?buildTypeId=bt123&...")

  4.  "username" and "password" - username and password of a TeamCity user that can
      trigger a manual build of the TeamCity build configuration defined in "build_type_id"

  5.  Since TeamCity uses BASIC authentication, it is highly recommended that the TeamCity server
      use HTTPS/SSL to protect the password that is passed unencrypted over the internet.
