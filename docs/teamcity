TeamCity is a continuous integration server that automates the building and
testing of your software.  The GitHub TeamCity service can be used to trigger
builds after code has been pushed to your git repository.

Install Notes
-------------

1. Your TeamCity server must be accessible from the internet.

2. "base_url" is the URL to your TeamCity server
   Example: https://teamcity.example.com/ or http://teamcity.example.com/teamcity/

3. "build_type_id" is the identifier of the build configuration you want to
   trigger. Multiple configurations can be triggered by specifying a
   comma-separated list of identifiers.
   Example: "bt123", which can be found in URL of the build configuration page
   ("...viewType.html?buildTypeId=bt123&...")

4. "username" and "password" - username and password of a TeamCity user that can
   trigger a manual build of the TeamCity build configuration defined in
   "build_type_id"

5. "branches" is an optional space-separated list of branches to watch commits
   for.  Commits to other branches will be ignored. If no branches are
   specified, TeamCity will be notified of all commits.

6. Since TeamCity uses BASIC authentication, it is highly recommended that the
   TeamCity server use HTTPS/SSL to protect the password that is passed
   unencrypted over the internet.
