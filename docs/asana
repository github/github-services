This service adds commit messages as comments to Asana tasks. Once enabled, commit messages
are checked for Asana task URLs (for example, https://app.asana.com/0/12345678/9012345) or task IDs
starting with # (for example, #9012345). Every task ID found will get the commit comment added to it. 

A commit with the message:

```
Fixes layout rendering bug. Reported in https://app.asana.com/0/12345678/9012345
```

will show up as:
```<commiter> pushed to branch <branch> of <user>/<repo> 
(http://github.com/<user>/<repo>/commit/<commit id>)
-Fixes layout rendering bug. Reported in https://app.asana.com/0/12345678/9012345```
