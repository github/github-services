This service adds commit messages as comments to Asana tasks. Once enabled, commits messages are checked for Asana task ID
in the format #<task id>. Every task ID found will get the commit comment added to it. 

A commit with the message:
`stub git call for Grit#heads test f:15 Case#1234`

Will show up as:
`<commiter> pushed to branch <branch> of <user>/<repo> 
(http://github.com/<user>/<repo>/commit/<commit id>)
-stub git call for Grit#heads test f:15 Case#1234`
