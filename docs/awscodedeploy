This service lets you deploy apps in [AWS CodeDeploy][1] when Deployments are created via the API.

You need to provide an AWS access key id and the corresponding secret access key having at least the permission for the `codedeploy:CreateDeployment` action. This is the minimal required policy file:

Note: You will need to replace “us-east-1” if you are using a different region, and replace “123ACCOUNTID” with your AWS account ID that is found on your Account Settings page.
```
{
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "codedeploy:GetDeploymentConfig",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:codedeploy:us-east-1:123ACCOUNTID:deploymentconfig:*"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "codedeploy:RegisterApplicationRevision",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:codedeploy:us-east-1:123ACCOUNTID:application:DemoApplication"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "codedeploy:GetApplicationRevision",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:codedeploy:us-east-1:123ACCOUNTID:application:DemoApplication"
    },
