====================

Install Notes

  * Requires **[Git Plugin][wiki] v1.1.18**, released 2012-04-27.
  * **Jenkins Url** is the base URL to your [Jenkins][] server, for example
    http://ci.jenkins-ci.org/. We will hit /git/notifyCommit under this URL (see

Details
-------

[Jenkins][] is a very popular Continuous Integration Server.

If you're using the standard [Jenkins Git plugin][wiki] to poll & check out your
repository, you can easily and quickly switch to a pushing model using this
service. 

It will send a request to your Jenkins instance telling it about the
repositories and branches that changed. Jenkins will then poll the repository
and build if needed. See [push notification from repository][wiki-push] on the
Jenkins wiki for information.
