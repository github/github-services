Slatebox
=======

Slatebox is a platform for developing 'off-rail' applications that live on "slates".
Use this service to create and manage new apps that live in the Slatebox environment.

Install Notes
-------------

  1.  Login to Slatebox and find your developer deployment key. This is listed alongside
your api key and secret key. Paste this key into the above "authorization" textfield.

  2.  "App Id" is a list of unique application identifiers delimited by "," (i.e. "foo" 
or "foo,bar") that pushes should trigger builds on. These are apps that you've previously
created using your Slatebox developer dashboard.

  3.  If your GitHub repository is private you need to add the "slatebox" GitHub user as 
a collaborator. This enables Slatebox to download the source code.
