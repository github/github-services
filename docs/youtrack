YouTrack - GitHub Integration Overview
---------------------------------------

Integration with YouTrack allows GitHub user to apply commands to YouTrack issues
right from commit comments.

--------------
Install Notes
--------------

1. YouTrack Requirements

- Requires YouTrack version 2.0 or above. YouTrack Energy EAP builds are
  supported as well.

- Your YouTrack server should be acessible from the internet.

- REST API must be enabled in your YouTrack server.

- Committer's email addresses in GitHub and YouTrack should be the same.
  YouTrack looks for user account of a committer by an email address, which the
  commiter has registered in GitHub. If YouTrack doesn't find a user account with the
  same email as committer's email, a command specified in commit's comment won't be applied.

2. Settings in GitHub

In the GitHub integration config, the following settings should be provided:

- YouTrack Server URL

- Administrator's account (e.g. 'root' user) credentials to access your YouTrack
  server.

- Name of a user group in YouTrack, in which YouTrack will search for committer's
  account.

---------------------------------
Essential YouTrack Configuration
---------------------------------

- Enable REST API via 'Administration' > 'Settings' section on your YouTrack
  server.

- Use an existing user group (or create a new one) with all users who commit changes
  in GitHub.

---------------
Command Syntax
---------------

General comment format for applying commands:


	[some comment text] #issueID <command_1> [command_2] ... [command_n]
	[some comment text] #issueID <command_1> [command_2] ... [command_n]
	...


*Important note:*
YouTrack tries to parse as a command any string after a hash mark (#) with an issueID till the end of the line.
If it contains any incorrect commands or attributes, the command will not be applied. If there is no command after
issue, that issue is marked as Fixed.
