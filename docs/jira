This service hook allows you to transition Jira tickets using the REST API available in
version 4.2+ of Jira. To interact with tickets in Jira you will need to place markup
similar to Lighthouse's in your commit message.

    Fixed an annoying bug [#WEB-210 transition:31 resolution:1]

This will perform transition 31 with a resolution code of 1 on the issue WEB-210. You can specify
any key value pair with the `key:value` notation, but at the very least transition must be present.

NOTE: As of 2.0.alpha1, the REST API will not automatically interpret strings into integers and vice
versa.

Install Notes
-------------

A user in Jira will need to be created for GitHub. It should be given full
access to all projects.

Using the following url as an example:

    http://jira.enmasse.com/rest/2.0.alpha1/issue/WEB-249

1. http://jira.enmasse.com is the server_hostname
2. 2.0.alpha1 is the api_version
3. username of the GitHub user in Jira
4. password of the GitHub user in Jira
