Instant project management for you GitHub repositories

See: https://huboard.com

HuBoard is built from the ground up using the GitHub public API. HuBoard issues **are** GitHub issues, you will never
have to deal with syncronization problems. Keep you issues where they belong, in the repository with you code.

By enabling GitHub's Service Hook integration, HuBoard keeps your agile boards up to date by sending events that occur
on GitHub directly to HuBoard.
