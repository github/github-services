This service automatically creates deployments based on your [workflow](http://www.atmos.org/auto-deployment).

By enabling this hook, GitHub will request a [GitHub Deployment][1] when the default branch is pushed to or your tests suite passes certain criteria.

If you use Continous Integration and GitHub you can select to "Deploy on Status" which will only create deployments when the default branch receives a "success" status for a commit.
