Install Notes
-------------

To set up this service hook, follow these steps:

1. Browse to your Code Climate [Dashboard](https://codeclimate.com/dashboard).
2. Click **Organization** in the top-right corner of the page. If this link isn't visible, see below.
3. Select the **Integrations** tab.
4. Copy the **GitHub Service Token** to your clipboard. Note that you do not want to copy the **API Token**.
5. Back in GitHub, paste the token into the text box below.

### Why don't I see the Organization link in Code Climate?

Few possible reasons:

* You're trying to set up a service hook for a repository that lives in the **Open Source** section of your **Dashboard**. Unfortunately we don't yet support service hooks for these repositories.
* Your Code Climate user is not a member of any organizations.
* You're in an organization but not in its **Owners** group. In this case, you unfortunately won't have administrative-rights to view this token.
