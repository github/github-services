## Notes

You may wish to reserve the nickname for the user in question so that it will 
always be able to connect to the room.

Note: This service currently enables all of the available hook events including
commit comments, downloads, forks, fork applies, wiki updates, issues, issue
comments, member adds, pull requests, pushes, and watches. However, not all 
events are posted to the MUC room. If you would like these events supported 
please raise an issue, or make a pull request!
