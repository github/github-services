If you want to use GitHub as your sole source control system, configuration
within FogBugz is relatively easy. 

In your site configuration:

  1.  Set "the Source Control URL for logs" field to be:
      https://github.com/[github_username]/^REPO/commits/^FILE
      
  2.  Set "the Source Control URL for diffs" field to be:
      https://github.com/[github_username]/^REPO/commit/^R2

If you have commits in FogBugz from a previous source control system, or if
you want to use multiple GitHub accounts, please read:
