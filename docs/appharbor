AppHarbor is a .NET Platform as a Service. Use this service to automatically trigger build, test run and deployment of your AppHarbor application when you push to GitHub.

Install Notes
-------------

1.  Go to your application's main page on AppHarbor and find the "Create build URL". Example: https://appharbor.com/application/{application_slug}/build?authorization={token}
2.  "token" is the value of the "authorization" parameter.
3.  "application_slug" is a list of unique application identifiers delimited by "," (i.e. "foo" or "foo,bar") that pushes should trigger builds on.
4.  If your GitHub repository is private you need to add the "apphb" GitHub user as a collaborator. This enables AppHarbor to download the source code.
