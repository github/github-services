AppHarbor
=======

AppHarbor is a .NET Platform as a Service. Use this service to automatically trigger build, test run and deployment of your AppHarbor application when you push to GitHub.

Install Notes
-------------

  1.  Go to your application's main page on AppHarbor and find the "Create build URL". Example: https://appharbor.com/application/{application_slug}/build?authorization={token}

  2.  "token" is the value of the "authorization" parameter.

  3.  "application_slug" is your application's unique identifier.

  4.  If your GitHub repository is private you need to add the "apphb" GitHub user as a collaborator. This enables AppHarbor to download the source code.
