The Generic Notifier allows you to send any GitHub event to a third party webservice over HTTP[S].  In order to support HTTPS with private CA certificates, the verify ssl checkbox can be left unchecked.

Install Notes
-------------

Enter the URL that event requests should be sent to.  The URL can be secured in one of two ways:

 * Add HTTP basic auth credentials to the url, e.g. http://user:pass@example.com/github_notification
 * Add an auth token to the url, e.g. http://example.com/github_notification/fab1edb10b5

Select the events you are interested in by checking the box next to each.

The Request Body
----------------

The request is made with two parameters:

 * event - the GitHub event that triggered the request.
 * payload - the GitHub-generated data for the event.
