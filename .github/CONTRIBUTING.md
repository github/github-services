## Updating an existing service

GitHub will only accept pull requests to existing services that implement bug fixes or security improvements. We no longer accept feature changes to existing services.

All pull requests will be reviewed by multiple GitHub staff members before being merged. To allow ample time for review, testing and deployment, there may be a substantial delay between the pull request being created and the pull request being merged by GitHub's staff.
